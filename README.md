# DBMS

Here are all the codes written for DBMS viva.

## Extendible Hashing
Run the file by directly running this command in the root directory : `make && ./ex.o`.

The code here takes a lot of inspiration from this [repo](https://github.com/nitish6174/extendible-hashing/blob/master/main.cpp)

## B+Tree
1. Plant the tree by `g++ bplustree.cpp`
2. Grow the tree by `./a.out`

## More to come
More codes and updates will be published as soon as possible.
